- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about software architecture and event-driven systems.
- 🚀 Along the years I have worked with multiple clients in finance and logistics which has helped me learn python, node, java, c#, kotlin and many other languages and frameworks. It has given me better insights into different programming paradigms.

- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love cooking pasta 🍝 and making pizza 🍕. What I love even more is eating them 😁.
